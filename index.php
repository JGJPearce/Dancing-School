		<p>Here at SDA, we pride ourselves on employing only the finest instructors, in order to ensure our students have the best
		 learning experience possible. We have over 50 years of combined dance experience in a great range of styles. We accept students
		  of all experience levels, from those learning their first steps to those who have been dancing all their lives. No matter where 
		  on this spectrum you fall, you'll have a place here at SDA. </p>

		<p>SDA was founded in 1826 by siblings Johnathan and Jacob Crocker. Jacob would teach the students classic dances 
			such as the waltz and the foxtrot, while Johnathan would provide accompaniment on the piano. Since then, the 
			academy has gone from strength to strength, growing into the renowned institution it is today. </p>

		<p>I look forward to seeing you here. </p>

		<p>Dr. Scratch, Head Dance Instructor.</p>
